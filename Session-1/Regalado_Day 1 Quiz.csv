Credit Scoring,"Credit Scoring is a numerical system that lenders (i.e. banks) utilize to gauge the likelihood that a borrower will be able to consistently make payments. In essence, a score is assigned to various selected factors that are related to an applicant's creditabilities.","Time-series forecasting,
